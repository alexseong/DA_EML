    "The first plot in the Figure below shows a synthetic two-class classification dataset with two features. The first feature (the x-axis value) is between 10 and 15. The second feature (the y-axis value) is between around 1 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four plots show four different ways to transform the data that yield more standard ranges. The `StandardScaler` in scikit-learn ensures that for each feature the mean is 0 and the variance is 1, bringing all features to the same magnitude. However, this scaling does not ensure any particular minimum and maximum values for the features. The `RobustScaler` works similarly to the `StandardScaler` in that it ensures statistical properties for each feature that guarantee that they are on the same scale. However, the `RobustScaler` uses the median and quartiles,1 instead of mean and variance. This makes the `RobustScaler` ignore data points that are very different from the rest (like measurement errors). These odd data points are also called outliers, and can lead to trouble for other scaling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MinMaxScaler`, on the other hand, shifts the data such that all features are exactly between 0 and 1. For the two-dimensional dataset this means all of the data is contained within the rectangle created by the x-axis between 0 and 1 and the y-axis between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `Normalizer` does a very different kind of rescaling. It scales each data point such that the feature vector has a Euclidean length of 1. In other words, it projects a data point on the circle (or sphere, in the case of higher dimensions) with a radius of 1. This means every data point is scaled by a different number (by the inverse of its length). This normalization is often used when only the direction (or angle) of the data matters, not the length of the feature vector."
