    "# THE BIAS-VARIANCE TRADE OFF\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we assume there's a real relationship between feature(s) and target and estimate this unknown relationship with a model. Provided the assumption is true, there really is a model, which we'll call __f__, which describes perfectly the relationship between features and target.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, __f__ is almost always completely unknown, and we try to estimate it with a model __f̂__ (notice the slight difference in notation between __f__ and __f̂__). We use a certain training set and get a certain __f̂__. If we use a different training set, we are very likely to get a different __f̂__. As we keep changing training sets, we get different outputs for __f̂__. The amount by which __f̂__ varies as we change training sets is called variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the true __f__, we use different methods, like linear regression or random forests. Linear regression, for instance, assumes linearity between features and target. For most real-life scenarios, however, the true relationship between features and target is complicated and far from linear. Simplifying assumptions give bias to a model. The more erroneous the assumptions with respect to the true relationship, the higher the bias, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, a model __f̂__ will have some error when tested on some test data. It can be shown mathematically that both bias and variance can only add to a model's error. We want a low error, so we need to keep both bias and variance at their minimum. However, that's not quite possible. There's a trade-off between bias and variance.\n",

    "The less biased a method, the greater its ability to fit data well. The greater this ability, the higher the variance. Hence, the lower the bias, the greater the variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse also holds: the greater the bias, the lower the variance. A high-bias method builds simplistic models that generally don't fit well training data. As we change training sets, the models __f̂__ we get from a high-bias algorithm are, generally, not very different from one another.\n",

    "Mathematically, it's clear why we want low bias and low variance. As mentioned above, bias and variance can only add to a model's error. From a more intuitive perspective though, we want low bias to avoid building a model that's too simple. In most cases, a simple model performs poorly on training data, and it's extremely likely to repeat the poor performance on test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we want low variance to avoid building an overly complex model. Such a model fits almost perfectly all the data points in the training set. Training data, however, generally contains noise and is only a sample from a much larger population. An overly complex model captures that noise. And when tested on out-of-sample data, the performance is usually poor. That's because the model learns the sample training data too well. It knows a lot about something and little about anything else.\n",

    "## LEARNING CURVES - THE BASIC IDEA\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have some data and split it into a training set and validation set. We take one single instance (that's right, one!) from the training set and use it to estimate a model. Then we measure the model's error on the validation set and on that single training instance. The error on the training instance will be 0, since it's quite easy to perfectly fit a single data point. The error on the validation set, however, will be very large. That's because the model is built around a single instance, and it almost certainly won't be able to generalize accurately on data that hasn't seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's say that instead of one training instance, we take ten and repeat the error measurements. Then we take fifty, one hundred, five hundred, until we use our entire training set. The error scores will vary more or less as we change the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus have two error scores to monitor: one for the validation set, and one for the training sets. If we plot the evolution of the two error scores as training sets change, we end up with two curves. These are called learning curves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a learning curve shows how error changes as the training set size increases. The diagram below should help you visualize the process described so far. On the training set column you can see that we constantly increase the size of the training sets. This causes a slight change in our models __f̂__.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first row, where n = 1 (n is the number of training instances), the model fits perfectly that single training data point. However, the very same model fits really bad a validation set of 20 different data points. So the model's error is 0 on the training set, but much higher on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we increase the training set size, the model cannot fit perfectly anymore the training set. So the training error becomes larger. However, the model is trained on more data, so it manages to fit better the validation set. Thus, the validation error decreases. To remind you, the validation set stays the same across all three cases.\n",

When training data is fitted too well, the model will have trouble generalizing on data that hasn't seen in training. When such a model is tested on its training set, and then on a validation set, the training error will be low and the validation error will generally be high. As we change training set sizes, this pattern continues, and the differences between training and validation errors will determine that gap between the two learning curves.\n",
